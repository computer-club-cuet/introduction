# What is this club about?
We, the students of Computer Science and Engineering, often face problems about resources when it comes to developing, system designing, or even when learning various problem solving techniques. The lack of resources, which could guide us through all the difficulties and make learning easier, and also make skill development faster, is the motivation behind this club.

Primarily, CUET computer club is founded to solve this problem for CUET students. It's here to build a community of CUET students(both ex and present), for creating resources of every necessary fields of Computer Science and Engineering.

But, in a broad way, all the repositories of CUET Computer Club, would be public, accessible for everyone from all over the world. So, anyone can learn from these resources and also anyone can contribute. In fact, we encourage and appreciate anyone, either from CUET or not, to contribute in this repository.
